<!--Here, we will create multiple folders for conferences. -->
Top tier machine learning conferences get larger every year and the number of accepted papers rises. This includes a lot of interesting papers from our community. Here, we would like to collect trustworthy ml resources from large conferences to highlight contributions from our community!
* Add links to the resources before a conference to draw attention to trustworthy ML talks. In this way, we can increase interactions on conferences and promote work from our community.
* Add papers/talks after a conference to complete the list of trustworthy ml resources for the given conference. 

If a conference is coming up we will provide a separate form for each conference we are covering.

Here, we will create multiple folders for conferences. 
* Add papers before a conference to draw attention to trustworthy ML papers. In this way, you can promote your own work or contributions by other researchers from our community.
* Add papers/talks after a conference to the general resources if you liked the contribution. This helps to highlight great work from our community.

If a conference is coming up we will provide a separate form for each conference we are covering. Note: Contributions added before the conference in the separate form won't be automatically added to our resources! 
<!-- _pages/publications.md -->
<div class="publications">

{%- for y in page.years %}
  <h2 class="year">{{y}}</h2>
  {% bibliography -f papers -q @*[year={{y}}]* %}
{% endfor %}
